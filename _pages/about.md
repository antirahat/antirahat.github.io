Hello World!! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Electronic Engineering & minoring in Mathematics (possibly VERY_SOON) at Independent University, Bangladesh. My research interest on topics related to **Natural Language Processing**, **Machine Learning**, **Smart Agriculture** and **Frugal Tech**. I dream to build technological solution to solve critical human crisis. I love to read, write and capture moments.
